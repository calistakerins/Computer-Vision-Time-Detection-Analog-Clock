# Time Detection on an Analog Clock
- Uses OpenCV (cv2) with Python to detect the time on an image of an analog clock.
- Traditional computer vision methods were implemented, including Canny Edge Detection, Hough Transform, and Scale-Invariant Feature transform.
- Project could be improved by using ML classifiers, but was not in the scope of the class project.
